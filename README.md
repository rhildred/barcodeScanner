barcodeScanner
==============

a barcode scanner from the [phonegap build](http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/configuring_plugins.md.html) example and [this plugin](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner) and [this example](https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cordova-Examples/tree/master/barcode)

I changed the cordova.js to phonegap.js in index.html and added the config.xml from the first phonegap build example. After that it just worked ... no fuss no muss!
